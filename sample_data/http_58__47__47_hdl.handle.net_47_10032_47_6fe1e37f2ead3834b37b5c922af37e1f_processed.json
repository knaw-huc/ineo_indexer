      "intro": "The IFA Spoken Language corpus is a free (GPL) database of hand-segmented Dutch speech. It was constructed with off-the-shelf software using speech from 8 speakers in a variety of speaking styles. The IFA Corpus has a total of 50,000 words (41 minutes/speaker). Dutch as spoken by adults (native speakers) in the Netherlands Of all recordings a verbatim transcript is made. A phonemic transcription was made by a lookup from a CELEX word list, the pronunciation lexicon. Unknown words were hand-transcribed and added to the list. In case of ambiguity, the most normative transcription was chosen. Phonemic labeling and segmentation: defining the phoneme (phoneme transcription) and marking the start and end point of each phoneme (segmentation).",
