                    "body": "### Overview\n * Alpino parses, POS-tags, lemmatizes and analyses morphologically any Dutch sentence that it is given. Alpino reliably analyses an input sentence syntactically, yielding a fully annotated syntactic tree with both constituents as well as explicitly labelled syntactic relations.\n\n* Alpino is a rule-based parser with a statistics-based disambiguation component.\n\n* Alpino's grammar has been augmented to build structures based on the guidelines\nof [CGN](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/corpus-gesproken-nederlands) (Corpus of Spoken Dutch) and [D-COI](https://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/DCOI/).\n\n* Alpino's output is formatted in XML, allowing it to be queried by formal query languages such as XPath. Tools such as [PaQu](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/paqu) and [GrETEL](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/gretel) leverage this feature and use Alpino in the background for querying purposes.\n\n* Developed by the University of Groningen, Alpino is available as a [webservice](https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/alpino/) hosted by the Radboud University Nijmegen, but can also be installed [locally](https://github.com/rug-compling/alpino)."

                    "body": "### Quick Use\nUsing Alpino is easiest with the [webservice](https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/alpino/), but requires one the log in using an institutional account. Once logged in, the user can create a new project, upload a tokenized or un-tokenized file (or input the text directly as plain text), and have have Alpino parse all input sentences. The output consists of one [FoLIA](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/folia) XML file for the entire input, as well as one file per input sentence in standard Alpino annotation.\n\nFor quick single-sentence parses, one can use the [online demo](https://urd2.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/bin/alpino) or [GrETEL](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/gretel). Neither options require a log-in, and both showcase the parse yielded as a tree for quick inspection.\n\n### Local Installation\n\nAlpino can also be installed locally. For this, we refer to the tool's general [User Guide](https://urd2.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/alp/Alpino/AlpinoUserGuide.html) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/rug-compling/alpino).\n\nSome more comments on using Alpino on Windows are necessary, however. Please read [Dani\u00ebl de Kok's blog post](https://danieldk.eu/running-the-alpino-parser-on-windows-10/) on this, if one desires to use Alpino on Windows.\n\n### Annotation Guidelines\n\nIn the end, the hardest part about using Alpino is understanding its annotations. For a detailed description of the syntactic annotations used by Alpino, one should check the document: [Lassy Syntactische Annotatie](https://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/Lassy/sa-man_lassy.pdf). For the annotation of parts-of-speech and lemmas, one should check the document: [Part of speech tagging en lemmatisering van het D-coi corpus](https://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/Lassy/POS_manual.pdf). *These documents are, however, only available in Dutch.*\n\nThe following document (in English) may also be useful: [Manual for syntactic annotators](https://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/DCOI/AnnotationGuide.html)."
