          "body": "### Overview\n * [OpenSoNaR](https://opensonar.ivdnt.org/) is an online application for exploration of and searching in the SoNaR and CGN corpora. In the Exploration (Dutch: verken) interface one can investigate corpus distributions, request statistics from sub-corpora, retrieve n-grams from sub-corpora and search for specific documents. In the Search (Dutch: zoek) interface one can use four different search strategies: simple (simpel), extended (uitgebreid), advanced (geavanceerd) or expert.\n* OpenSoNaR can be accessed on (https://opensonar.ivdnt.org/).\n* To use OpenSoNaR, an account is required. Employees of universities or research institutes from the Netherlands can log in with the user ID and password of their own organization. If you do not have an account at an academic institute, please apply for an account at [clarin.eu](https://www.clarin.eu/).\n* The SoNaR corpus contains more than 500 million words of text from various domains and genres. All texts were tokenised, POS tagged and lemmatised. The named entities were also labelled. All annotations of SoNaR were produced automatically.\n* The Corpus of Spoken Dutch (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands, CGN) is a collection of 900 hours (almost 9 million words) of contemporary Dutch speech, originating from Flemish and Dutch speakers. The speech fragments (spontaneous and prepared) are aligned with various transcriptions (including orthographic, phonetic) and annotations (lemma, POS tags). All annotations have been verified manually, except for the phonetic transcription: only 11,3% was verified.\n* Due to the size of the corpora the number of hits shown in OpenSoNaR is limited to 8 million hits. If the results of your query exceeds this limit only the first 8,000,000 hits will be shown."
