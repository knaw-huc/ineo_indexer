(NEW in v4)\n  * Capture parts of matches.\n  * Group and sort result sets on many criteria, such as the text preceding the match.\n  * Highlight hits in a document and keyword-in-context (KWIC) view of hits.\n  * Actively developed since 2010, with many [plans for the future](https://inl.github.io/BlackLab/guide/future-plans.html)."

          "body": "### Try it online\nFor a quick example of the BlackLab Frontend web application, have a look at either of these:\n\n* [Brieven als Buit](https://brievenalsbuit.ivdnt.org/corpus-frontend/BaB/search/) (\"Letters as Loot\"), where you can search a collection of historical letters to and from sailors from the 17th to the 19th century;\n* [Corpus Gysseling](https://corpusgysseling.ivdnt.org/corpus-frontend/Gysseling/search/), a small corpus of historic Dutch (1200-1300).\n\nWith a [free CLARIN account](https://idm.clarin.eu/unitygw/pub#!registration-CLARIN%20Identity%20Registration), you can also check out:\n\n* [Corpus Hedendaags Nederlands](https://chn.ivdnt.org/);\n* [OpenSonar](https://opensonar.ivdnt.org/).\n\nHere are a few searches you can try (click on the Extended tab):\n\n* **Lemma: \"koe\"** Finds all forms of the word \"koe\" (cow). Other words to try: \"wet\" (law), \"zien\" (to see), \"groot\" (large).\n* **Part of speech: \"NOU-C\"** Find all common nouns. Other values to try: \"VRB*\" (verbs), \"ADJ*\" (adjectives).\n* **Word: \"coe\"** Find a specific historic spelling of \"koe\".\n\nThis is just a small sample of the capabilities of BlackLab.\n\n### Documentation\n\nIf you're excited about the possibilities and want to get BlackLab up and running yourself, we kindly refer to the [BlackLab Guide](https://inl.github.io/BlackLab/guide/getting-started.html).\n\n### BlackLab Corpus Query Language (BCQL)\n\nBlackLab Corpus Query Language or BCQL is a powerful query language for text corpora. A guide to speaking BCQL can be found [here](https://inl.github.io/BlackLab/guide/corpus-query-language.html)."
