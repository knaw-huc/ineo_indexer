The mines were home to a special subdialects of Limburgian, and these mines therefore form an extension to the Limburg town network. It is possible to search for these mines specifically in the e-WLD.\n\n* Together with the [e-WALD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewald), [e-WBD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewbd) and the [e-WGD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewgd), the e-WLD forms a series of electronic dictionaries.\n\n![Original in-press publication of the *Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten*, that the e-WLD makes available digitally.](https://github.com/CLARIAH/ineo-content/blob/master/media/boeken-wld.jpg?raw=1)\n\n![Subdivisions of the Limburgian dialects.](https://github.com/CLARIAH/ineo-content/blob/master/media/dialectkaart-wld.jpg?raw=1)"

          "body": "Together with three other electronic dictionaries, the e-WALD forms a series:\n* The [e-WALD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewbd) (Electronisch woordenboek van de Achterhoekse en Liemerse dialecten);\n* The [e-WBD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewld) (Electronisch woordenboek van de Brabantse dialecten);\n* The [e-WGD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewgd) (Electronisch woordenboek van de Gelderse dialecten).\n\nThe e-WLD was originally published as an in-press publication. More information on the books and volumes can be found [here](https://e-wld.nl/delen).\n\nThe source code that facilitates the Django web applications of the electronic dialect dictionaries can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ErwinKomen/RU-Wnd).\n\n### Credits and Contact Information\n\nThe e-WLD application was developed by Erwin Komen of the [Technical Support Group of the Humanities Lab of Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/facultyofarts/research/humanities-lab/our-labs/) under the supervision of Henk van den Heuvel. Thijs Hermsen made the map on the homepage.\n\nFor technical information or issues regarding the e-WLD, you can contact dr. Henk van den Heuvel (H.vandenHeuvel@Let.ru.nl), Director CLST & Head of the Humanities Lab.\nRegarding the contents of the e-WLD, you can contact prof. dr. Nicoline van der Sijs (post@nicolinevdsijs.nl).\n\n#### Editing and digitization\nIn 2015, the first two volumes of the *Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten* were digitized thanks to a grant awarded by CLARIN for the project 'CARE: Curation and integration of regional dictionaries' led by Nicoline van der Sijs, Henk van den Heuvel and Roeland van Hout (RU).\n\nEric Sanders (RU) designed a macro and script for semi-automatic digitization. Research assistant Aukje Borkent, data curator Linda van Meel (thanks to a subsidy grom the Raod veur 't Limburgs), student assistants Jorik van Engeland, Inge Otto, Lisette van der Heijde and Hanna van den Heuvel, and interns Maaike Borst and Eline Dimmendaal had all texts read by the macro and the result was accurately corrected manually. Volunteers Jantien Kettenes-Van den Bosch and Herman Wiltink have carried out a pre-correction for many parts.\n\nJoep Kruijsen, one of the original editors, offered his enormous know-how for the digitization and carried out a lot of correction work; for example, he corrected all phonetic signs from volume II. Corrections of the first volume are not yet available on the e-WLD."
