During this lecture, Wijnen expanded on how complete and correct CHAT annotations can be generated on the basis of transcribed actual utterance-correct version pairs:\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/870688674?h=be1200bc9f\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"    allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Getting Started with AuChAnn\n\nYou can install AuChAnn using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install auchann\n```\n\nYou can also optionally install [``sastadev``](https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/sastadev)\nwhich is used for detecting inflection errors.\n\n```bash\npip install auchann[NL]\n```\n\nWhen installed, the program can be run interactively from the console using the command `auchann`.\n\n### Import as Library\n\nTo use AuChAnn in your own Python applications, you can import the `align_words` function from `align_words`, see below. This is the main functionality of the package.\n\n```python\nfrom auchann.align_words import align_words\n\ntranscript = input(\"Transcript: \")\ncorrection = input(\"Correction: \")\nalignment = align_words(transcript, correction)\nprint(alignment)\n```\n\n#### Settings\n\nVarious settings can be adjusted. Default values are used for every unchanged property.\n\n```python\nfrom auchann.align_words import align_words, AlignmentSettings\nimport editdistance\n\nsettings = AlignmentSettings()\n\n# Return the edit distance between the original and correction\nsettings.calc_distance = lambda original, correction: editdistance.distance(original, correction)\n\n# Return an override of the distance and the error type;\n# if error type is None the distance returned will be ignored\n# Default method detects inflection errors\nsettings.detect_error = lambda original, correction: (1, \"m\") if original == \"geloopt\" and correction == \"liep\" else (0, None)\n\n### Sastadev contains a helper function for Dutch which detects inflection errors\nfrom sastadev.deregularise import detect_error\nsettings.detect_error = detect_error\n\n# How many words could be split from one?\n# e.g. das -> da(t) (i)s requires a lookahead of 2\n# hoest -> hoe (i)s (he)t requires a lookahead of 3\nsettings.lookahead = 5\n\n# Allow detection of replacements within a group\n# e.g. swapping articles this will then be marked with\n# the specified key\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n# Transcript: de huis\n# Correction: het huis\n# de [: het] [* s:r:gc:art] huis\nsettings.replacements = {\n    's:r:gc:art': ['de', 'het', 'een'],\n    's:r:gc:pro': ['dit', 'dat', 'deze'],\n    's:r:prep': ['aan', 'uit']\n}\n\n# Other lists to adjust\nsettings.fillers = ['eh', 'hm', 'uh']\nsettings.fragments = ['ba', 'to', 'mu']\n\n### Example usage\ntranscript = input(\"Transcript: \")\ncorrection = input(\"Correction: \")\nalignment = align_words(transcript, correction, settings)\nprint(alignment)\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe `align_words` function scans the transcript and correction and determines for each token whether a correction token is copied exactly from the transcript, replaces a token from the transcript, is inserted, or whether a transcript token has been omitted. Based on which of these operations has occurred, the function adds the appropriate CHAT annotation to the output string.\n\nThe algorithm uses edit distance to establish which words are replacements of each other, i.e. it links a transcript token to a correction token. Words with the lowest available edit distance are matched together, and based on this match the operations COPY and REPLACE are determined. If two candidates have the same edit distance to a token, word position is used to determine the match. The operations REMOVE and INSERT are established if no suitable match can be found for a transcript and correction token respectively.\n\nIn addition to establishing these four operations, the function detects several other properties of the transcript and correction which can be expressed in CHAT. For example, it determines whether a word is a filler or fragment, whether a conjugation error has occurred, or if a pronoun, preposition, or article has been used incorrectly.\n\n### Development\n\nTo install the requirements:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo run the AuChAnn command-line function from the console:\n\n```bash\npython -m auchann\n```\n\n#### Run Tests\n\n```bash\npip install pytest\npytest\n```\n\n#### Upload to PyPi\n\n```bash\npip install pip-tools twine\npython setup.py sdist\ntwine upload dist/*.tar.gz\n```"
