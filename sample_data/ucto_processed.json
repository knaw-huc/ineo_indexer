First check if there are up-to-date packages included in your distribution's package manager. There are packages for Arch Linux, Debian, FreeBSD and Ubuntu.\n2. If not, it is strongly recommended to use the [LaMachine](https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine/) software distribution, which includes Ucto and all necessary dependencies, and runs on Linux, BSD and Mac OS X. It can also run as a virtual machine under any host OS.\n3. Alternatively, you can always download, compile and install Ucto manually, as described below.\n\n#### Manual installation\n\n* [Source code](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ucto/)\n* [Stable releases](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ucto/releases)\n\nTo compile these manually consult the included INSTALL documents, you will need current versions of the following dependencies of our software:\n\n* [ticcutils](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ticcutils/) - A shared utility library;\n* [libfolia](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/libfolia/) - A library for the [FoLiA](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/folia) format.\n\nAs well as the following 3rd party dependencies:\n\n* [icu](https://icu.unicode.org/) - A C++ library for Unicode and Globalization support. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, install the package ``libicu-dev``.\n* [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/) - An XML library. On Debian/Ubuntu systems install the package ``libxml2-dev``.\nA sane build environment with a C++ compiler (e.g. gcc or clang), autotools, libtool, pkg-config.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe Ucto documentation can be found [here](https://ucto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n### Python binding\n\nUcto can be used from Python through the [python-ucto](https://github.com/proycon/python-ucto) binding, which has to be obtained separately unless you are using [LaMachine](https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine/).\n\n### Support\n\nThe development and improvement of Ucto also relies on your bug reports, suggestions, and comments. Use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ucto/issues) or mail lamasoftware (at) science.ru.nl."
