                    "body": "### Overview\n * Alpino parses, POS-tags, lemmatizes and analyses morphologically any Dutch sentence that it is given. Alpino reliably analyses an input sentence syntactically, yielding a fully annotated syntactic tree with both constituents as well as explicitly labelled syntactic relations.\n\n* **alud** derives [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) from Alpino's output (in XML, in the alpino_ds format), and writes it in the [CoNLL-U format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html). Alternatively, output can be embedded into the alpino_ds format, making them available for XPath queries.\n\n* **alud** is also capable of inserting given Universal Dependencies into the alpino_ds format.\n\n* **alud** was based on a translation of an xquery script, [``lassy2ud``](https://github.com/gossebouma/lassy2ud).\n\n### Universal Dependencies\n\n[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) is a programme that aims at cross-linguistically consistent tagging and dependency parsing. UD is an open community effort with over 500 contributors producing over 200 treebanks in over 100 languages. If you\u2019re new to UD, you should start by reading the first part of the [Short Introduction](https://universaldependencies.org/introduction.html) and then browsing the [annotation guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html) on the UD website."
